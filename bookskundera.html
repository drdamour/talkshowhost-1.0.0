The next time i heard of this book <a href="books.html#al">Al Balber</a> was reading it. The third time was when i went on Amazon and searched for Milan Kundera because Al told me he was his favorite</td>

author. I ordered it and it was the second Kundera novel i read after Unbearable lightness of being. Sadly i remember very little of this novel.  There was this GREAT device of moving back and forth in time (common in Kundera) and i am reading it next after Karamazov.  At this point i will give a better review, rest assured though if you read this book you will LOVE it.

<U>Part I: Lost Letters</U><BR>
The book starts like most Kundera's, no introduction.  The first chapter is his reflect on history, this time <a target="adfgasfsadf" href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/go/Gottwald.html">Klemet Gottwald</a> (The Link is a simple Bio, i might get more on him later).  He talks about some picture where the party erased a person because he was convicted of treason (<a href="booksmz.html#1984">1984ish</a>).  Then he introduces the first Character, Mirek, who seems to write semi-anti communist feelings "The Struggle of Man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting."  He calls his mistress Zdena, and is driving to see her after he breaks his arm and gets some free time.  he is being followed, and he goes to a mechanic friend so he can fix his car, you learn that a communist revolution is still taking place with Russia's invasion. Kundera starts to define the human race as trying to reach an idyll, and that the communist revolution in Czech didn't support this, just a plan to make it better, no morals. The mechanic fixes his car and he goes on his way, with the people following him still.  You learn that Mirek was a good scientist suppressed by the Russians and he knows his life is near its end and wants to change his past. Then you learn the Zdena was ugly! this is why Mirek is so ashamed, no because of her passion for the communists, but his own respectability was in danger. he had been with her because he didn't like himself, didn't think himself worthy of prettier girls, and denied it when asked about it. When he meets with Zdena it is apparent that she has been told to set a trap for him by the police, to tell him to surrender. It turns out that Zdena isn't' being controlled by the party, but that she is pretending to be so Mirek has some hope, for she loves him.  She is faithful to the party only because she wants to make Mirek feel bad about his unfaithfulness (him leaving). he asks for letters he wrote to zdena (evidence of their affair) and she reminds him how sentimental they were, making mirek recall all the lies of his past.  His supposed breaking with his father. She refuses the letters, and he leaves.  When zdena's attention is brought to the secret security men, she gets scared, and tries to lie about them, "they're not following you". Mirek sneaks away from his pursuers and admits to himself that he wants to erase his past because he loved zdena, and Kundera talks about how all people only want to change the past, and that is why they seek power in the future. When he returns, he finds that his documents have been seized by court order. Mirek wanted to go to jail deep down, so that he wouldn't be forgotten like those who fled in the beginning.

<U>Part II: Mama</U><BR>
You are introduced to Marketa (f) and Karel (m) and how they moved away from Karel's parents. After Karel's father died, Marketa starts to feel guilt and writes to Mama. They agree to ask her to stay a week, saying she must leave on Sunday because she must go somewhere. When the day comes mama says that it was Monday that something was to be done, and that she was leaving on Monday. Marketa felt pity for the lady, and allowed it. Then you learn that when the Russian tanks came, mama treated them with indifference, because they would be forgotten, but her pear tree would remain important. Also she wasn't as interested in Karel anymore, and instead of making him mad these things make him happy because he felt she was right and she had lifted her hold on all the information regarding her son. On Sunday Eva arrived, she is Karel's girlfriend that Eva met first, and they are better friends. they met in a spa and Eva is a man chaser.

Eva talked loudly to mama so that marketa wouldn't walk in naked, and she came in wearing a robe. Mama talked to Karel and the girls, but only Karel was listening, she recited the poem and remembered the last stanza even though it was a Christmas poem. then she told Karel how Eva looked like Nora? he makes Eva stand up (naked waist down!) and he recalls mama's beautiful friend Nora and remembers seeing Nora naked when he was 4, making a strong impression on him. he role played with Marketa and Eva and felt like he was jumping between child and adult, after he conquered them both he screamed "I am Bobby Fisher!" Then Marketa goes over in her head about how Eva invited her to have  threesome with her husband and testing out sex with a stranger she imagines karel without a head. in the morning she decides to go, but hesitantly, and Eva assures her that karel won't suspect anything. Karel takes mama back to the train station and realizes that the previous night was one of the top 3 of all time. He sees mama as shrinking into nothingness year by year and sees beauty as the joining of ages. he asks her to stay with them, but she declines. He gives her money like a schoolgirl, and waves goodbye.

<U>Part III: The Angels</U><BR>
A short and challenging section of the book, this really has three separate parts.
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Subpart A: The girls</i><BR>
Two girls Gabrielle & Michelle are taking a class taught by Madame Raphael and must analyze <a href="http://www.rhinoionesco.cjb.net/">Rhinoceros</a> by Eugene Ionesco. The believe it is a <input type=button onclick="alert('relating to or being the stage of psychosexual development in psychoanalytic theory during which a child becomes interested in his or her own sexual organs, I looked it up!')" value="Phallic"> Symbol. You should probably read the theory part first to understand this: The began to present it in class, but they have these horns on to be phallic, then they give their analysis, the teacher loves it. Then this girl they pissed off earlier kicks them in the behind. The class starts laughing, Raphael thinks it is all part of the presentation and she starts laughing. the girls start crying, but Raphael can't see them, then Raphael pulls the two girls into a circle and they start floating away, leaving the kicking chick behind (sahra).
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Subpart B: Kundera the Astrologer</i><BR>
When the Russians came, Kundera lost his job. Friends asked him to write in their name, but this was dangerous. He takes a job as an astrologist and is good at it. He likes it because his forgotten history has been somewhat reborn. The head of his magazine asks him to do a personal horoscope (Angel-> Devil). he uses the horoscope to shape the attitude of the chief. One day, Kundera sees Eulard in a circle dancing and starting to float off, but really Kundera is falling. Two years after R got him the astrology job the police interrogate her. She is scared of them and Kundera realizes he can't live with his loved ones without causing them pain. Before his final fall from the circle he thinks of Raping R, grabbing hold of the circle to say.

Kundera believes that when 'angels' become 'devils' we find this humorous/less weighty. in cases of the opposite we also laugh, but it isn't the same, it's the exact opposite in meaning. A crime of history is the confusion between the two things.
</td>

He quotes a passage of Annie Leclerc about uncontrollable laughter, and argues that when this strikes you forget about history. Then he talks about the false unity of police and army, it's commanded!, but the true unity of youth. He talks about the importance of a circle, that when you leave it closes up and you can never reenter, but a row you can add yourself to the edge. There is also a strong feeling of falling down and away from members of a circle when you leave it.
<BR>
<BR>
<U>Part IV: Lost Letters</U><BR>
Kundera talks about how he hesitates to create characters, because they are made ever 3 seconds or so. He names this lead character Tamina, born in Prague walking the streets of some unnamed town. She works in a cafe, and is popular. Kundera believes her popularity is due to the phrase "It's absolutely the same with me" a phrase used not to extend the original speakers thought as it is cleverly disguised, but to change the subject to oneself, and stop listening. Tamina never does this. You meet Bibi, ten year younger with 1-year-old daughter at her barstool, and thinking about going to Prague. Tamina asks her to pick something up if she does go. Tamina called her mother in law and asked her to look for the parcel in a desk drawer, and the woman starts to cry. Tamina is forced to stay on the line for an extended period of time and pay a large bill. You find out that Tamina and her husband had signed up for a trip, but really had defected from the country and had to leave their personal belongings behind, including a journal of their life, something that Tamina's husband had forced her to write. The eleven years that they lived together were kind of forgotten, events were remembered, but their specific order was all lost. The notebooks would fix that, and give back Tamina her life. Tamina couldn't have the parcel pass through the mail cause of the black list "we are only immortal in police files" and she needed to solidify her relationship with Bibi, bibi wanted to meat Banaka, who was a bad writer, to learn how to write. So Tamina set it up.  Tamina thinks about her posthumous fidelity, it's caused by the thoughts of her husband watching her. She feels she is his only connection to this world and it would wound him.  Banaka is an ugly guy but cut convinces bibi a novel should be about oneself, not about everyone else.  This is because if you write about others, you write about what you don't know, and are hence lying.
<BR>
This brings us to an aside by Kundera in which he meets an ex sailor whose ship sunk and was forced to swim for 3 days. The sailor now suffers from insomnia and must write his life story at nights.  Kundera makes the connection that we write because our children will not listen to us. He talks of graphomania and says three things are necessary for it to exist. (1) Elevated level of well being, allowing people the time. (2) Social Atomization/Isolation (3) Absence of Dramatic Social Changes.   he sees a future of universal graphomania in which everyone listens to his or her own voices and no voices filter in from the outside.
<BR>
Hugo asks Tamina out, and she accepts because he has a phone.  He finds it very difficult to gain entry into her mind. They go to the zoo and the ostriches run up to tamina and talk with their pate mouths. Tamina believes that the ostriches were telling her a bad omen about the package, and she tells Hugo about it. He asks if they are political documents and she lies and says yes he tells her to make bibi believe they are Unimportant! love letters. She says how she can't go back there, because then she is betraying her husband. She remembers that when her husband died she sent out notifications with no response. She swallowed sleeping pills and swam far out, but could not fall asleep.  They are all together watching TV and man is on it saying that for the past 50 years he's had sex on an average of 2 times a week and at 5 seconds an orgasm, that means he's had 6 minutes and 56 seconds of orgasm. Tamina Laughs thinking about it all at once. She asks Bibi to use her phone and calls her dad and begs him to go to her mom and get the letters, but he refuses and suggests her brother, tamina asks him to call her brother for him. Her father suggests that she take his fur coat instead of the worthless letters, meaning she would choose him over her dead husband. Tamina wanted the letters ASAP because she was afraid others would read them and lessen their value. Bibi comes in and tells Tamina that her husband is now talking about going to Ireland instead of Bohemia and that she is fed up and doesn't want to go anywhere because she just wants to write. Tamina dreams about the ostriches. Kundera talks about the death of beauty and silence of a ring falling, making beauty audible (Thomas Mann). He says that the ostriches weren't giving her a bad omen, but rather talking about themselves. When writing a man becomes a universe, and a universe must be unique and therefore if another universe exists (another man) then it threatens the original. If everyone doesn't pay attention all the time, no one does, so all writers are nothing. Hugo invites Tamina to dinner again, she accepts because she is her last hope. he talks about his realization of power because of Tamina, and confirms that he will go to Bohemia for her. Tamina's dad calls and says her brother will get the papers. Hugo says she can always use his phone, and he knows she will never sleep with him. Even in the negative these words make him feel good, Hugo embraces her and undresses her, all the while Tamina envisions her husband. When Hugo begins he finds tamina is dry. Hugo doesn't stop and makes her get on all fours, she preoccupies her mind with the documents and her tips form that day, and Hugo closes his eyes until orgasm.
<BR>
Her Mother had opened al the letters and read them. This did not ruin them like Tamina had thought, instead it made her want them more.  They had been ravaged like her. Hugo got with Tamina whenever he wanted, but she did not enter his inner life. Tamina asks him about Prague, he says his paper has made him an enemy and he can't go, he realizes she doesn't love him. he thinks that he would go if only she would enter his world. he said he wanted her to not suffer. She got sick because she could recall his cock'n'balls (revulsion) and not her husbands (tenderness). They walked off, he stopped, and she did not. She never went to Prague again.
<BR>
<BR>
<U> Part V: Litost</U><BR>
Kristyna is 30 married and with child. she has an affair with a mechanic. She met a student, but wouldn't go far with him. She did this because she liked how the boy quoted poets and philosophers and was worried he would stop if they had sex. She also could not have a child, and there was no birth control so she didn't want the awkwardness of instructing the student. they decided krystina would come visit the student's one bedroom, meaning she would spend the night there. Litost: state of torment caused by ones own site of one's own misery. Examples.
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>A man and woman go swimming, the man has little ability, and the girl is very athletic. She keeps a slow pace to stay with her man, but at the end she wants show off some ability and goes quick. The man can't keep up and chokes on water. Later he yells at her for it, he's feeling litost, when she starts to cry and he hugs her, his litost melts away.</blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A boy is forced to learn the violin, and messes up. His teacher yells at him, and he makes more mistakes. He repeats this pattern, and as the pattern repeats he feels more litost.</blockquote>
love is the cure for misery, and hence the cure of litost, but when absolute loves plagues us with not being absolute we suffer litost. litost is inexperience, and revenge, the man can't swim he is hurt, so he slaps the woman and makes her cry, making them love each other again. it also requires lies and hypocrisy. The man must tell the girl it isn't from his shame, but from his fear of the woman drowning he slapped her. The boy plays bad notes to make it look like it's purposeful, and not a lack of talent. the student was litost incarnate, and was horny. Voltaire as he is called, wants the student to go to a poets meeting the night krytina was coming. Voltaire tells him to reschedule, and this is quite an honor. He again declines the request. the next night, krystna came on an errand, and met him in a restaurant. the student didn't like her appearance and she was upset at the scrappiness of the restaurant. he wanted to take her to his room immediately and she wanted to visit the capitol. He went to the next restaurant, but i was filled to. He finally found one and sat her down amongst thoughts of what a mistake it was to not meet the poets. He mentioned that this famous poet called him, and Krystna knew the name right away, and viewed him with admiration, she learned about him in school after all. he mentions the poets meeting, and how thrilled he is to be with krystna and how only a select few were invited to the meeting. Krystna bought it, and told him he must go. she went to his room while he went to the meeting, but she asked him to get the poet to inscribe a copy of his book to her. the student quickly agreed, feeling guilty from taking away her movies and night out. Kundera talks about how he sees al these great poets from a room he rents 20+ years and 2000 km away. He names them all after famous poets following the Voltaire route. the student overheard the petrich say, "something about women always gives them the upper hand. i could go on with it for weeks.: Goete tells him to give him 10 minutes worth. Petrach tells a story. his wife was taking a bath and a girl from a poetry club came to his door and said she had to see him. He told her to go to the cellar and then he took two buckets and told his wife he was going to the cellar. He mentioned this was stupid cause he had been complaining about gallbladder problems all day. he went down to the cellar, but all the girl would say is that she had to see him. His wife started to come down the stairs, and he told the girl to go to the street and wait for him. he told his wife he was going to take a bath, and snuck out, playing a trick with the shoes he wore. Boccacio interrupted and praised his intelligence in the heat of passion. He went out in the street and told the girl to come back the next day, when his wife was away. But she just ran to the door of his building. Boccacio broke in and told petrich that he should have thrown her under the streetcar. Petrich then told the girl she had to go, or he'd never see her, and he ran towards the overflowing bathtub, but the girl chased him. When he got to the door. He shut and locked it and ripped away the doorbell wire. when he went back to the door after turning off the tub faucets, she was still there. Boccaio tells Petrich that he shouldn't have had the poetry group, and goethe calls him a <acronym title="a hatred of women"><u>misogynist</u></acronym>. Boccacio claims that this is the best form of man because there are two types of men, poets and misogynist. The former worships femininity and the latter worships women, and women prefer and can only be happy with the latter. Petrach defends himself by saying that he told the truth to his wife a that moment, and Boccacio said that shows his worshipping her by revealing everything. his wife went to the door, but no one was there, then they heard the girl smashing all the windows in the apartment, and she stepped through the bedroom window (even though he lived on the 4th floor?) and his wife held him back because she feared for his life. He pushed his wife aside, went up tot eh girl and took her by her hand. Lermontov said he didn't believe a word of it, but Boccacio said it must be true because hysterics always go after poets because they won't get slapped because the poets worship them. Petrich continued with his story: The girl took his hand and said, i am simple and came here for love, so that you may understand what true loves is once in your life. then the girl looked at his wife and said, don't hold it against me because i love you to, and took his wife's hand. The student looked around and tried to decide which poet he liked best, he chose lermontov because goethe had just said his problem was hyper celibacy. The student looked at shi watch and realized he must return home, so that he wouldn't end up like his friend. Instead of going home he went to the bathroom and met Lermontov who said he was proud, and went out to the group and said he was proud. Everyone laughed at him, but the student came to his defense, saying how it was important for poets to be proud because none else may understand their works. The other poets, proud of themselves, but shy to admit it agreed with their silence. The student told goethe about his plain looking woman in ridiculous clothing and gold tooth, and goethe applauded him because this woman was real, not made from directions and a computer. The waiter came in and told the poets that they had to leave, or the caretaker would lock them in. Everyone started to go except Goethe, who demanded to stay. The other poets fearing his wife told him to go home, but Lermontov said that goethe was trying to reclaim his youth, and that he would help him by staying the night with him. Voltaire knew that Goethe didn't want to go, because alcohol made him unable to walk, so he demanded that all the poets carry him out of the restaurant. The student wanted to help, but lermontov kept talking to him, and grabbing him. Lermontov kept making fun of the poets carrying him, and when petrich wouldn't agree to calm Mrs. goethe, lermontov took the responsibility, got in the taxi and drove off. Petrich took the student in arm and told him the end of his story. His wife allowed the girl to spend the night, and his mother in law had the windows replaced before he woke up. Petrich mentions that Boccacio's poems are stupid because he doesn't merge with the subject, but instead laughs about it, and how laughter can only separate man from the world. The student agreed with him completely. Kristyna was asleep, and the student woke her with a  kiss, then told her about he night. Uninterested she said he probably forgot  the book, but he showed it to her and she was very impressed. the student tried to open her thighs, but she held them together. On his 25th attempt she told him that it would kill her, but he misinterpreted this as believing she would not be able to live without him. he said he would die too, thinking these great words of passion, but he still didn't understand so he eventually gave up. that morning she explained tit to him, but he was upset saying that he would have been cautious. She decided that she liked the permanent motional love over the quick physical love they might have had. She was happy, she had the book and had held a lover by his erect member for an entire night. The student was shocked, all he had to do was assure her he would not have gotten her pregnant and she would have been his. He returned home deep in Litost. Kundera then makes final notes on Litost, he claims that all heroes suffer from litost, like the child who played the wrong note until the teacher went insane and killed him. His victory laid in his teacher's future arrest, caused by the child's litost. The student felt great litost and wanted to hurt kristyna, but it was to late. He thought of Lermontov and felt a paper in his pocket. It was a note from Kristyna and it said meet her at midnight, he knew it was old and that his own stupidity had made him lose her. His litost had no channel of escape. He went back to the writers club, but the poets seemed to not know him. He was deep in litost, everyone had abandoned him, when Petrach had finally motioned to him he had already decided to leave. He left the note from Kristnya so that someone may know that he was loved. Petrach followed him out to the street and made hi come back in. He read the paper and when lermontov came over he read it to him, they both believed that he wrote it in verse. Lermontov, the one the student came to see was turned off by the student's un-honest poem and remained at the club when Petrach and the student left. Kundera sees him remaining with his never-ending litost.

<U> Part VI: The Angels</U><BR>
This starts off with the clementis antic dote again. Apparently Franz Kafka went to school at this very same building and walked these steps, and his father owned a shop in the basement. (Did you know that Kafka means Jackdaw in English [did you know what a jackdaw was? {it's a bird} i didn't]). Kundera explains that Kafka's bohemia has no name, and that the streets keep changing names, Schwerinova Street under Germany, Cernokostelecka Avenue under Austria Hungary, Marshal Foch Avenue after world war I, Stalin avenue was where tamina grew up, Vinohrady avenue she was picked up by her husband. Changing the names causes there to be no name, and no history. he talks about his country's 7th president, <a href="http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/7/0,5716,42547+1+41618,00.html?query=husak">Husak</a>. Apparently under his reign 100+ historians were driven out and many other intellectuals disappeared. One historian, Milan Hübl, came to Kundera's house and said that when you take away a history, another will be written and people will forget whom they are. Their own language will die before their eyes because it has no relevance. He saw this happening, and today Kundera sees the impending death of Czech. Kundera talks about his father whom for the last ten years of his condition deteriorated and could make less and less coherent thoughts. In his mind there were no names, just objects and he couldn't communicate with anyone. One day Kundera was called into his father's room, and his father pointed to the Beethoven music and said, now i know. Tamina continued to serve coffee with the backbone of namelessness. One day she snapped at bibi, and bibi snapped back, their friendship was no more. Another day she didn't come to work, the owner of the shop stopped by her place, but the door was locked. The police forced open the door, but found no evidence of anything, the case was filed as unsolved. Before this one day a man came into the shop and called tamina by name, she was unimpressed. He told her he knew she was sad, but she again was unimpressed suspecting he was trying to get to her flesh. But he kept asking questions and Tamina was interested, it had been so long since she had been asked such questions. Kundera describes love as a never-ending interrogation. And that police interrogation is just the symmetrical depth of the height of love. Just as we can mistake depth for height and vice versa. He even claims that some lonely people wouldn't mind being interrogated by police to appease their solitude. The man tells her she isn't remorseful of the events, but of the forgetting of events. She agrees and asks him what to do, he says forget the forgetting. Tamina goes and gets into the mans car and Kundera says that Tamina is the main character, the laughter and forgetting of Prague, and that all the other stories touch her as if through a mirror, and that the man's name is Raphael (which i don't get, cause the only other Raphael was the teacher!?) Tamina remembered a portion of her life with her husband when they got to the cliff's edge and she wanted to go back and reclaim her husband, but someone interrupter her plea with a whistle. Down the cliff they went and tamina was put into a boat with 12 yr old boy. She sat down and watched Raphael smile and nod as she left. The boy rowed for a while, but he started to look tired and tamina asked if he would like her to take over, he agreed and she rowed for a while ignoring the boy with his rock music and obscene gestures. A song came on that Tamina thought everyone knew, but the boy did not. The reached the shore and Tamina saw many small volleyball nets. The boy whistled to a 9 yr old girl and the girl took tamina to a white building, that turned out to be a dormitory. She told Tamina that she had been assigned to the squirrels, but tamina asked aboutthe lack of adults. The girl referred to Tamina as a child and told her there were no adults. Tamina said she wanted to go back, the girl ignored her, but when she repeated her request the girl asked her why she came if she wanted to go back. She went to search for the boat but it was gone, she traveled the coastline and realized she was on an island. When she returned to the children they were in a circle. They opened it up and asked Tamina to join, but she declined. When her husband died she was not there, it was at night, and they had already removed his body from the bed. Tamina at first feared death, because of the nothingness, but later on the fear subsided and what disgusted her was teh idea of becoming a corpse. Thats ine if the reasons she tried ot drown herself, her dead body would only be viewed by the fish. Kundera talks about how when stories are writen about people dying, it is depicted as a journey because people want to hide their corpse. this happened with his own father, but not so in teh physical sense, but in the riding away of his father by the condition of his mind, continually deteriorating. Tamina decides to fight the children, but first she must befrend them. In order to do this she must wash in front of them nakid when it si the squirrel's (her group's) turn. She feels taht her hairy groin makes her queen over the bald groins. Tamina likes it here, because her husband does not exist for her. She has forgot the forgotten, and begun to remember old childhood arousals. because her team alwas won teh games, the squirrels wanted to reward Tamina and so they said that they would be her servent, but it was really just a pretext to touch her all over. Tamina began to feel great pleasure from this within her body, and her sould left teh room. Kundera goes on about how music has reverted to a monitone form and that there is no action anymore no diversity, everything is joined and eternal and that everything will be forgotten with this music. He cites Karel Klos's emigrated and Husak's pleading for him to reamin, because husak knew that hsi music allowed the forgetting of beethoven adn souch to continue. Tamina was expieriencing sex that was not tied to love and angelic. As time went on the kids had become competitive over her sexuality and had learned to hate her and each other. One day she got pinched hard on the nipple, and Tamina stopped the encounters. They were playing hopscotch whena arguement broke out about if Tamina stepped on a line or not, after a good 15 minutes of arguement, Tamina said she did, but this just infuriated the squirrels. I fight broke out adn many children got bloody noses, but one child through a stone against tamina's head and bleeding she went to her bed determined to stop playing their games. Tamina gets caught in the volleyball nets and begins to bleed. The kids don't consider her a kid so this isn't wrong, just liek we don't consider cows to be humans so it isn't wrong to hurt them. She is again forced to play the games and she has forgotten everything now. Kundrea recalls Husak's speech about children and how they are the future, adn Kundera realizes that children are teh future becuaes they don't look back just like people today don't look back, hence people are becoming more childlike. One day she notices a boy taht looks liek the rower, she searches the island but finds no boat. The children spot her and come running towards her. Tamina jumped in to the water and started swimming towards the shore form which she came. The sun went down and she lost her way but she conitnued on because she had this desire to live. She wasn't living on teh island, but wherever she was goign she was going to live. When day broke she found the isalnd only a hundred meters behind her, and her legs getting very heavy. A boat of children came by, but they didn't even try to save her, tehy just watched her.

<U> Part VII: The Border</U><BR>
You meet Jan who loves the expression of women's faces during love making. His curent girl, Edwige, didn't make a face though. Every time they made lovehe resolved to not do it the next time he saw her, but every time they still slept with each other. Kundera talks about the last 200 years being considered the invasion of the balckbird into the cities of earth. He relates this to Jan's period in life as being his escape from Prague and into USA. He is talkign to Hannah the actrice and she mentions meeting jan's old friend, Passer. Passer has bad cancer and is no longer a man doue ot operation. Hannah kept mentioning how great a person Passer was, as every had been doing ever since hsi cancer. Jan visits a house of friends. They were watching a program about toples women on the beaches adn the father, the eternal compromiser said to jan that women should be topless as long as their breast are beautiful. His daughter reproached him by commenting on his uncovered oversized belly. She continued to say that she took her top off for herself, and not anyone else. That she was not anyone's sex object. Jan replied taht it's very easy notot be a sex object. This left a risidual quietness throughout the room, at which point papa mentioned passer and his encounter with Hanna. They told Jan about how Passer, who had acrush on Hanna, went mushroom picking with her and had become exausted and had to go to the hospital the following day. Papa mentioned that it was serious, adn jan should go see him.

Jan's Philosophy: The beginning of life is arrousal without climax, and the end of life is climax without arousal. The perfect example for the later case was the sales girl jan met. She told him their love maaking would not be emotionaly pleasing, but technically pleasing. She was an orgasm fanatic too, they symbolized what everything was leading up to. The last time Jan left the girls place, he remembered the opera conducter Hertz who made the women stick pencils in their rectums in order to check their spine positioning. A soprano who got into afight with him made this technique public and Hertz left the country in shame. Ever since Jan could only view the Opera as an erotic escapade, and knew that hertz would be ashamed of what Jan had just worked so hard for. And it wasn't equal to what hertz had down with no effrot at all. Kundera admits that this story si liek teh invasion fo the blackbirds because it is the backside of teh story taht was going on. It is just abstract stories of his life that jan wouldn't pay much attention to. Barbara, a friend of Jan's, was known for having sex parties and jan had always avoided them. This time Jan agreed to go becuase he was crossing the border soon, and any shame he may recieve would be meaningless. Kundera talks about the three relatioships we have. The first is the women we have had, the second in the women we wished we had, and the third is the women who wanted us and we wanted, but never had. Jan had this situation once with a girl he met ona train. teh reason he never had her was because she was on the other side of the border. Kundera defines this border as the change betweeen life taht has meaning and life that has no meaning, weightless.  While jan was talking to Edwige about rape and it's eroticism and castration and it's lack of everything, Edwige talked about how ultimately it doesn't mater because the act of sex is just a symbol of friendship. Jan was happy about this, and he fell asleep next to her without sex. 
A Woman that Jan had been seeing very hastidly on eday smiled at him as they were undressing. Jan almost started to laugh, and if he had, he woul dhave corssed the border adn they woul dno longer be abl eot make love. Jan went and saw passer who was near death. Jan tried to convince passer that all life was near deatha dn teh futre was bleak, mkaing passer not feel bad about his death. But Passer rebuted his arguement saying that change was on it's way. Jan said that the change was bad adn Passer smiled at him. This smile was to show tolerance for his friend. Jan  thinks about the border adn defines it as the product of repatition. A comin repeatin gthe same melody over and over again made people cross the border and caused great laughter. Kundera says that this is just one way to cross the border. he recalls one of jans expieriences wishing at age 13 that a female had more than one erotic spot. This showed that at age 13 jan had already become bored wiht women and the border was already visible to him. At passer's funeral there were four speeches. During the fourth speech, papa clevis' hat blew off his head and fell on teh ground. He decided not to go affter it but it cause more of a distraction than getting it so he went after it. The wind kept blowing it until it blew into the grave. When teh speaker finished he went to throw dirt on the grave and saw the hat. The border at that point was visible but he had to stop from crossing it. The same thing happened to passer's family. At barbara's party, jan met another man and they discussed how barbara was training them for teh olympics as she went around and caused immense sexual energy at teh party. While jan was getting some barbara was workign the old man, but they started to stare at each other, and then they start laughing out loud. Barbara came over to jan and told him she didn't want what happened at passer's funeral to happen here. He said he was sorry and laughed harder. She Asked him to leave. Jan came over to edwige's hotel room on a nudist island just before he was to leave for america. The sight of all the peoples nakidness made him come towards teh border. He talked to edwige about it, but she misinterpreted his meanign as believeing this was a call against soscieties ideas. When he said that thishotel should be called on teh other side, edwige thought he was talking about society as a jail,a nd this being on the other side of that. They ran into some other people, and one of them started lecturing about the fall of the west. Jan listened without interest. "As their naked genitals stared at teh beech"
