I don't plan on dying, i just stopped thinking it possible. I will be around for a very long time and i've coem up with an idea to accomplish this..

Okay, i can clone myself when i'm forty and then when i'm sixty i transplant my brain to the nwo 20 year old clone. this process repeats at 20 year intervals, so i live to be 40 then i'm 20 again. If i want i can change the starting and ending ages as it goes on.
