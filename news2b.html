So i've done a few things to make this website artistic as hell! oh yeah, but more will come and then the content from the other pages will work it's way into here in ways.  Pretty much all for now
<br>
<br>
Alright i figured out how to change the properties of pages within a frame, so now everything is very cohesive, the playlist basically has a transparent background.  Everything is changing on the mouse over color except this window when mouse is over, and that' sonly because i haven't figured out a pretty color scheme yet.  I also need to work on the C-style sheets so they look better.
