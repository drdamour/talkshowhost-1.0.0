Well the ultimate book on overcontrolling government.  The teleprompters and the fake revolutionary groups to weed out would be uprisers and the burn holes where nothing is remembered.  This books characters names always elude me other than Winston, the anti-hero.  The cool thing about the book is that Ingsoc is so awesomely organized.  Basically Ingsoc is the collection of teh greatest minds, and they control everything and reap all the benifits.  They control all media, so everyone thinks everything is great.  Winston tries to rebel, it has to be his innerself adn morality telling him that this is wrong, but he fails against the awesome power of Big Brother.  This is vague and it will remain that way because everyone should read this book.

This is the 2nd Chuck Novel, and the third i read after Fight Club & Invisible Monsters.  Again this is an Awesome Book just like the other ones!  This guy really writes some awesome moral stories. The pages are numbered in reverse, so are teh chapters becasue you are counting down to your lead character (Tender Branson's) Death.  He starts his confession and the story precedes: First you find out that he's a maid, and that he likes it.  Chuck always gives these tidbits of information to get you into the characters mind, for this book it is <a href="tenderbranson.html">cleaning techniques</a> (posted 10/30/2000), maybe one day i'll write them all down?!  Okay, so he's a maid and he helps peopel with their ettiquette. While telling them how to eat lobster the one he is eating turns out to still be alive, this has importance because it's the symbol of how much of a drone he is, not even to realize his surroundings, and he is indifferent to it. You learn that by mistake his number was given as a self help line, when people called he told them to kill themselves.  When the original ads readers dwindle down, (at the same time creedish cult survivor's own numbers are dwindeling too) he posts his number around to get more 'clients'.

Trevor Hollis calls one day, and he shoots himself as per tender's rquest/command.  When tender goes to the grave he meets fertility Hollis, trevor's sister. He falls in love wiht her, she's hot, and she is disgusted about him, he later learns when she calls his number and talks to him, not exactly knowing that they are the same person.  She has orgasims over the phone, she's a freaky chic.  When she calls again, she wants him to get off, but he tells her to fuck teh guy she met inteh cemetary (who is him) but she says no, but will makea date with him.  On their date tender leanrs taht Fertillity has dreams that let her know the future.  She demonstrates this in an apartment store, wher ethere was a fire, but they were 2ft away from teh fire, before it went out, always safe.  You learns about a cruiser that her brother knew was going to only half sink, and they were the only ones on the boat.<BR><BR>
Then tender narrataes about these diseases he faked for the social worker, cause you later learn she was WAY off in the cause of his problems. Then he learns about how the suicides of the Creedish cult members, don't seem to really be suicides, but murders cleverly disguised.  Then after he meets with fertillity another time, it turns out he is the last creedish cult member.  He gets this super agent and he starts explaining how thye have all teh wonderdrugs names patented for the future, and thye created this media craze about the creedish cult.  The creedish land is turned into a porno dump, and a deposit law is made on porno.  The <a href="tenderbranson.html#prayers">book of common prayers</a> comes out (i will copy these down soon![10/29/2000 said & up on 10/30/2000!]). Aynways, he starts a tv show and his popularity starts to drop.  Then he finds fertillity again and she gives him a 'miracle' of prediction.  his popularity starts to rise again, and he masa mock wedding during teh halftime of the superbowl.<BR><BR>
At the superbowl (it's not even his real wife) fertility tells him taht the agent will die, because his brother (Adam Branson) whom he saw on a bus with fertillity, who killed the social worker and all the other supposed suicides, poisoned the agent.  You learn by this point about creedish life, simple on the farm, and that the oldest son is the perosn who stays within the church lines, and all other kids are domesticated and sent out to send moeny to the creedish church, who buy more land, and slowly they expand, taking over the world an acre at a time.<BR><BR>
The Agent dies, and tender must fleed, bein suspected for murder of many epopel to become the icon he is.  Adam takes him and tells him the truth about creedish culture, that they didn't live off the farm, but off teh moeny being sent into them from their slaves, the kids. he foudn it out when he turned 18, and he called the sherif, who called the IRS/FBI which caused all the members to commit suicide.  He found out that the kids had to watch birth (this is what sets him off) and therefore get scared of sex, this strong empowerment. He talks of sex as this uplifting thing that empowers all people and that the pill changed the world. Well he drives a car and slams it into the creedish monument, and the little plastic jesus liek tender gets stuck in his eye, and he makes tender kill him with a stone ontop of all the porno. The fertillity comes and she tells him about her job, being a fertillity clinic<BR><BR>
This is the end, i swear: They go back to tender's original employers, and fertility has sex with the man, trying to get pregnant, but she is sterile. then she has sex with tender, and the next day something unforseen happens, she is pregnant.  She onyl stayed with him so that something unfroseen would happen.  Well she knows a plane is going to crash, and she gets on it, but tender tries to stop her, and takes over teh plane, adn it turns out taht he's what makes the plane crash.  Fertillity said that he would live happily ever after, but i think that means he dies, who knows?

This is the best book in the history of the world.  There is no greater, nor superior book.  Milan Kundera is my favorite author, and he makes my favorite books, but this is just better.

<a href="http://www.aynrand.org/objectivism/">Objectivism</a> is an incredibly sophisticated view of the world.  A lot of peopel dismiss it because they find a few problems with it here or there, i hate those people.  The overall idea is correct, we are selfish.  We live for ourselves and anything that doesn't make us the best is our own damn fault.  I believe that i will become succesful in the world and that other people will live off of me, like leaches.  It is true, i mean where would we be without the giants like Microsoft, Dow Chemical, or the superstar General Electric?  Nowhere. Read this book, read fountainhead, read every book by her, i have.
<BR>
Surprisingly enough this book was recommended by my father, where he heard of it, god only knows.  He did not understand the book that well though and doesn't even know about objectivism.  Ayn Rand was the first author that i introduced to <a href="#al">Al Balber</a>, a man who introduced me to Doestoevsky, Kundera, Hesse, and the list goes on.

This book was recommended to me by my Hyper-intelligent molecular biologist uncle Bob.  I love his name title-contradiction.  Anyhow, for those of you surprised by all the heavy moral struggle and life issues, this is fresh air.  This book is plain funny, but it didn't make me laugh out loud THAT much (i rarely do while reading, although hitchiker's guide is an exception).  The ideas are still cool, and he is a good writer.  I liked it, homophobs beware! I often question myself if these stories are true, i think they have to be half true.  This book is just a collection of essays about his life, just like Barrel Fever, but these seem more true.

Apparently C.P. Snow was a smart guy. I never heard of him, however this book was the first to adress a problem that we all know about nowadays.  The two cultures are Science and Hummanities.  Snow felt that there wasa great divdie, and that schools were too focused on teh humanities (remember he is english) and that we need to produce more engineers and chemists.  This was essential because the poorer countries in the world coudl only become rich if the richer countries export science trained people.  There is truth in this, but the bigger picture is the division that he identified.  Why is that divide there?  I don't experience it in myself, but i see it all the time outside myself.  Anywho i had to read it for MSU <a href="http://www.msu.edu/course/lbs/133/kirkman/">LBS-133</a> (see other books for that class: <a href="#lbs133b">Consilience</A> | Life is a Miracle).  I feel that i understand the problem a tad better because of reading it, but it really isn't necessary.

Kurt's biggest book and the best one ot read to start him (so i'm told) It's abou tthe fire bombing of dresden, which most peopel don't know killed more germans than the a bomb did japenese. (The a-bomb was one bomb though :)) It's pretty good book, and i liked how quickly it read. That's why i'm not doing the full review on it as such, because you can read it in like 4 hours. And there isn't much plot to it really, so i should remember it well enough. If i don't, then that is my own business.
<BR>
Basically to make the book more interesting, teh main character, billy has the ability to move back and forth through time. But just his thoughts and mind move to his latter day or prior day body. He could do this long before his abduction by the aliens called Tralfamandorians (who are the reason the universe ends). This just kind of gives color to the book. Billy gests captured by germans and then gets used as slave labor i dresden, and his group are the only survivors of the firebombing that they can find. There is a teacher, Edgar Derby, who gets shot in the end of the book in teh middle of dresden for steeling a tea cup from a corpse in teh middle of a burnt out city.  IT's good read it.

Ok, this book is a philosophy on the rligous faith in scientific doctrine.  confusing enough? cause the text is.  When you finally map out his ideas piece by piece you start to understand Wilson's beliefs. The man things that everything is explainable in scientific terms.  He does this by saying everythign is physics.  For example if you laugh at a joke, he would break it down in this way:
<BR>
<LI>The philosophy of the laughing
<LI>Takes place in this part of the brain
<LI>Which is caused by this type of biology
<LI>Which is caused by these chemicals
<LI>Which is caused by these physics
<BR>
From there he builds up to teh higher levels and explains all humor.  Of course he admits that we don't have the proper understanding of the universe to do this yet.
<BR>
This book is LONG, not in pages but so many ideas.  I like it, it gives a great interpretation of the world from a scientific viewpoint, but only that.  I will need to reread it when i start forming my own opinions, of course my own opinions coudl be being formed from this book.  hmmm.  Anywho i had to read it for MSU <a href="http://www.msu.edu/course/lbs/133/kirkman/">LBS-133</a> which is a class i like. (see other books for that class: <a href="#lbs133a">The Two Cultures</A> | Life is a Miracle)
