Well Karamazov got finished and my head seriosuly hurt so i picked this up and started reading it, and couldn't put it down. No damn novel! Woohoo. This is a seriously great story though, and it is being made into a movie. The lead character is Leonardo DiCaprio, which is gay shit but save one fact, it's perfect type casting. Frank is a con man who at the age of 16 looks like he is about 25. Now leo is the opposite beign about 25 looking 16 but it will still work. Cause he can pull off the oppossite effect.
The story is great. He starts hsi career b conning his dad out of 3400 bucks. He gets sent to a home of correction, but after leaving finds his dad to be much poorer. He runs away adn lives around new york for a while until he realizes he can start cashign bad checks and make good money. He needed a cover for thsi operation and low and behold he comes up with an awesome idea. Airline Pilot! They are always traveling and always need to get checks cashed plus they are respected and get free deadhead trips all over the world. after about tow years he starts to get worried he is going to be caught so he settles down in Atlanta. While there he forges his way to becoming a head doctor on the night shift in a emergency ward. He later goes to colorado and passes the bar and forges his way through law school at harvard. He joins the attorney general's staff and works in teh courtrooms for months. Then he goes to Utah and teaches two classes at the university witha "phd" from columbia. throuhout his trips he is caught and released, he impersonates fbi adn police agents. He travels aroudn europe with 8 college girls as his "crew" using their presence to cash huge amounts of checks. He finally gets caught in France, and lives thorugh 6 months of hell, but later he is extradited to Sweeden were he gets his passport revoked and gets sent to USA. He escapes by "flushing himslef down the toilate", but is later caught. However in the prison, the guards mistake him for a fbi inspector undercover and allow him to leave the grounds without resistance. When he finally gets cornered in a DC motel, he simply walks out and tells them that he is an FBI agent waiting for his pursor's (an fbi guy named O'reily) arrival and walks away. He never served any time in the US, but was finally hired as a white collor crime consultant by the FBI! Great true story, teh movie shoudl be very entertaining.

This is an awesome novel.  Sadly i can't remember most of the precise events.  Raskolnikov was the lead character although he ahd many differnet names (i call this the russian sydrome).  This man is hurting for money, so he tries to rob this old woman whom he pawns things too.  While there he decides to kill her, now wait, he decided to kill her before, i can't remember i'll need to reread it at somepoint, sorry about forgetting, anywho... He robs her and kills her, adn her servent liek girl too.  The weird thing is, she is sucha nobody adn him even less that he gets away with it!  At first he falls into a bitter sleep from illness directly after it.  There is something to do with, wait he does decide to kill her first because he takes teh weapon, an axe-knife  from the kitchen in his residence.  Ok there is somethign to do wiht the money he steels, and how he can't get rid of it but eventually he hides it in some obscure place (I'm surprised i remember so much!)  Anyhow there is this girl who is forced to becoem a prostitute because of a death in her family and he falls in love with her and her with him out of spite i want to say.  HE eventually can't take the guilt and turns himself in, adn the chic follows him to siberia.  There is a lot more to the story, so you should read it.

This was recommended to me by <a href="#al">Al Balber</a>.  He read it till the end, and then lost the book, so i read it and told him the ending.  I really liked this book, and am currently 1/4th through The <a href="#Karamazov">Brothers Karamazov</a>, a Doestoevsky's masterpiece.

<TD>
The Middle Brother and sharing a mom with Alyosha.  He gave his will money (he got it before his father death per an arangement) to Katerina so that her father/his commanding officer wouldn't die in shame.

He feels large shame now, and asks alexi to ask hsi father for more money, but then storms in and beats the old man, apparently because teh old man like Grueshinka as well.  This seems to be the main focus of the book so far.

He is the eldest brother of Alexi (Alyosha).  He came from a different mother, but so far the mothers don't matter.  He supposedly likes Katerina and wants dmitry to leave her.  he has yet to become that important in the book.

Katerina said that she once fell in love and that man left her, but he was too combe back.  She was rude to Katerina (wouldn't kiss her hand, after she received katerina's kiss) and seems to be the antagonist of the novel.

made peace with each other. The church is strong again, buta  new religion of somewhat has formed.  It is in a place called Castilia that we learn of Joesph Knecht the glass bead game leader.  The glass beadgame is a game where symbols of things like a song, or a physics equation are placed in specific relationship to each other to understand each other.  It's kind of funny i read this right before LBS-133 which mostly dealed with the combining of knowledge in this way (<a href="booksmz.html#lbs133b">Consilience</a>|<a href="booksmz.html#lbs133a">The Two Cultures</a>|Life is a Miracle).  Joesph could see into the future and understood a need for castilia to join forces with other institutions like the church, and felt so strongly towards this he gave up his magister ludi (what they called the leaders of teh glass bead game) and went on his own, but only for a hsort period, for he meets with faith soon.  Since this book is written in the distant future, about the nearer future, it was really cool to think about. You get the idea that Knecht's ideas were at fist ignored, but later done because of the success of Castilia in teh future.  It has lot of strong morals about religion and life in it. In the end there is some poetry of Hesse (actually Knecht), but i don't think it is well translated.  In the last pages there are these three 'lives' that Knecht had to write during his schooling.  They are very good short stories in themselves, and actually give you a great understanding of knecht, and his selflessness.  There are other characters in this book, there is a music master who attains near perfection, a model that knecht tries to copy. There is also a friend that lives outside castilia, although he was schooled there adn is fighitng to keep castilia financially afloat.  A respected father in teh catholic church also plays a vital role in Knechts becoming what he is. there are some other peopel in castilia wh play minor rolls, but they are all written well and represent something.  Overall everyone shoudl read this book at one point in their life, they will learn something from it, but there IS A STRONG downside.  Hesse is preachiga littel altruism here, and i'm completely against that, but you know, i'm not gonna hound him about it.  It was one of his desired religion's (something i am also against, but he does support the inward religion the most respectable of all) top priories.

Some great moral dilemmas: Production vs. Intellect(pure) | Outward Religion vs. Inward Religion | Class struggle | Teaching vs Research

Good question: Could Hesse predict the future?
