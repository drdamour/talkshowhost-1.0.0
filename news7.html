<td>Hmm, where to start. I've been messing with <A href="http://www.camwhores.com/" target="_XXX">Camwhores.com</a> at least been watching, it's rather interesting, so it made it's way to the <a href="links.html" target="right">links page</a>. These people are one of the great subcultures on the internet, and their little personal webpages have inspired me to actually do something to mine.  I have such a creative mind, i know that i can come up with somehting great.  I got a new DV camera, the canon <a href="http://www.canondv.com/zr_s/zr20/features.html" target="zr-20">ZR-20</a>, so i'm going to mess with trying to get it to work as a webcam in some way.  I redid my <a href="playlist.html" target="right">Playlist</a> because of the hard drive crash.  It's smaller now, but i'll add more to it.

<td>Not a whole bunch has changed in a while, fixed the IM links because i changed my aim name.

Updated the <a href="gifts.html" target="right">gifts page</a>, so buy me crap!

<TD>Wow 8 months eh? I updated the <a href="gifts.html" target="right">Gifts</a> page.  I've kind of lost interest in this project somewhat, since it still is without any point whatsoever, mayve i should start selling something, or making something? Give me some <a href="mailto:damour@msu.edu">Ideas</a>. i've been doing a lot with mIRC and using ascript called <A href="http://invision.lebyte.com/" target="right">Invision</a> and i'm usually on irc.nitro.net in #IsoWorld my handle is DrDaMour
<br>Also Added a new link to the <a href="links.html" target="right">Links</a> page.
<br>
<br>Also i got some virus and lost every file on my computer, so my mp3s have dwindled to only 500 now, but that'll be fixed when i go home and reencode all my other cds. It did set me back a little
