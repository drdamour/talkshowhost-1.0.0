Added some links off the "pi navigation menu" (love that title).  Only guestbook it working right now, and it's basically a duplicate from version A, beucause that was the most artistic thing that i did on version A, so it makes it to B.  Working on the gifts page right now too, cause that is important to have!

Got rid of the scroll bar, bought myself another 15 pixles of width to play with,d on't worry if you aren't viewing in 1020x780 the bars will show up, but why wouldn't you be?
