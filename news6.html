<TD>WoW, i did it. If you haven't come here in a while, it will tell you what is new, and what isn't by putting ** around the archive link. Don't believe me? you can test it by changing the date on your computer to 1997, refresh twice (once to save the old date to cookie, the second to recall it) and you'll see all the links will have *'s around them, but beware, if you jump two months AHEAD in the date, the cookie that holds your last visit time will expire so you may see the message when you first show up. Screw with it, and you will see what i mean.</TD>

<TD>Screwed with the cascading style sheets, notice the scroll bars. Added the thing that says you have been here X times. Got rid of the frame border, thinking about getting rid of the scroll bar, but that means people would have to view this in 1024 by 768, which my computer at home doesn't even do. Gonna mess with the news thing so that it says if the news is new according to your last time of visit. I'll also screw with the style sheets on all the other pages to make the scrollbars look decent, maybe even fix these a little too. Also, added the DaMourNET icon. To see it add me to your favorites folder, or hold shift click on the icon in the location url box, then move it to the right a little and let go, it will load. Got rid of the stock ticker, it was stupid anyways (was messing up too).</TD>

<TD>Added some links to the <a href="links.html" target="right">links</a> page. Messed with the Paper Mario Super Site Award (<a href="right.html#amap" target="right">see</a>) pages and such, made the application process better.</TD>

<TD>New Layout! I will not be a layout whore, this one will be around for a year or two. Added the 4th <a href="cube4.html" target="right">Borg Cube</a>. Check it out. Few changes here and there, i won't go through them, they are small. Still working on a purpose page, that is a page that is not without purpose. LAter</TD>
