Today i decided to start a second version of my website, this on is based on form before function, unlike the other site.
<br>
<br>
Asuka makes it on because she is so cool.  I haven't really decided how i'll be doing all of this but so far i like the basic layout.
<br>
It is an attempt to try to make pretty things as opposed to cool ones, which is a change for me.
<br>
<br>
we'll see how it all works out in the end.
