<head>Tv is Evil</head><body>



People shouldn't watch tv when they are young or old, except for certain things that a of true qulaity and expland the mind (or are real funny) call me a hipocrit if you want, but watching a show about teens without family (ahem 5) just doesn't seem like a role model situation
<p>
check out this wicked quote froma  recent study, USA today.
<p>
"When a class of six- to eight-year-olds watched public television's big-hearted purple dinosaur, "Barney," they sang along, marched along, held one another's hands, and laughed together. The next day, the same class watched the aggressive rappers and singers. Within minutes, they were karate-chopping and high-kicking the air -and one another"
<p>
see how much cooler they acted when they listened to musik instead of taht gay barney dood? j/k.  But Tv really is the downfall, look either way these kids wre completely turned towards the way the show persuaded them, should our kdis be persuaded by a bit moe realistic charater?
